Penetration Testing Toolkit:
This toolkit is designed to assist penetration testers in identifying and exploiting potential vulnerabilities in a network or system. 

- Modules Included:
  Port Scanner: Scans a range of IP addresses to identify open ports.

  Brute-Forcer: Performs brute-force attacks to test passwords.

- Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.

Necessary libraries for each module (e.g., socket, requests).

1. Port Scanner
Purpose: Scans a range of IP addresses to identify open ports on a network.

Setup:

Ensure Python is installed.

Install the socket library if not already installed.

Usage:

python port_scanner.py
Input the target IP address and port range when prompted.

Review the list of open ports displayed in the output.

Example Scenarios:

Network administrators can check for unauthorized open ports.

Penetration testers can identify potential vulnerabilities in a network.

2. Brute-Forcer
Purpose: Performs brute-force attacks to test passwords.

Setup:

Ensure Python is installed.

Install the itertools library if not already installed.

Usage:


python brute_forcer.py
Define the charset and max_length in the script.

Run the script to generate possible password combinations.

Example Scenarios:

Test password strength for user accounts.

Identify weak passwords in a system.
